## 🎯 Introduction: Why Conditionals Rule

Welcome to the **most epic** journey through Python conditionals! 🎉 

Conditionals are like the GPS of programming - they help your code navigate through different paths based on conditions. Think of them as the decision-makers that give your programs intelligence!

### What You'll Learn:
- 🔍 Master all types of Python conditionals
- 🚀 Write cleaner, more readable code
- 🧠 Think like a Pythonic developer
- 💡 Solve real-world problems with style

---

## 🏗️ Basic if Statements

### The Foundation of Decision Making

The `if` statement is like asking "Hey Python, **IF** this is true, then do something awesome!"

```python
# Basic if statement syntax
if condition:
    # Do something amazing!
    pass
```

### 🎭 Real-World Examples

```python
# Example 1: Weather Decision Maker 🌤️
weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
    print("🌞 Perfect day for coding outdoors!")
    print("Grab your laptop and find a nice spot!")

# Example 2: Age Verification System 🎂
age = 25

if age >= 18:
    print("🎉 You're an adult! Welcome to the world of responsibilities!")

# Example 3: Password Strength Checker 🔐
password = "SuperSecure123!"

if len(password) >= 8:
    print("✅ Good password length!")
    print("Your digital fort is well-protected!")
```

### 💡 Pro Tip: Truthy and Falsy Values

Python has some sneaky truthy and falsy values that can make your conditionals super powerful:

```python
# Falsy values in Python (these evaluate to False)
falsy_examples = [
    False,      # Obviously false
    0,          # Zero
    0.0,        # Zero float
    "",         # Empty string
    [],         # Empty list
    {},         # Empty dictionary
    None        # None type
]

# Everything else is truthy!
if "Hello":
    print("🎯 Non-empty strings are truthy!")

if [1, 2, 3]:
    print("🎯 Non-empty lists are truthy!")

if 42:
    print("🎯 Non-zero numbers are truthy!")
```

## 🔄 The Power Trio: if, elif, else

### The Ultimate Decision Tree! 🌳

Sometimes life (and code) isn't just black and white. That's where our power trio comes in!

```python
# The Holy Trinity of Conditionals
if condition1:
    # First choice
elif condition2:
    # Second choice
elif condition3:
    # Third choice
else:
    # Default fallback
```

### 🎮 Interactive Grade Calculator

```python
def get_grade_with_style(score):
    """
    A fun grade calculator that gives you more than just letters!
    """
    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
        message = "🏆 Absolutely LEGENDARY! You're a coding wizard!"
        emoji = "🧙‍♂️"
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
        message = "🎉 Excellent work! Keep up the momentum!"
        emoji = "🚀"
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
        message = "👍 Good job! You're getting there!"
        emoji = "💪"
    elif score >= 60:
        grade = "D"
        message = "📚 Time to hit the books a bit more!"
        emoji = "📖"
    else:
        grade = "F"
        message = "💥 Oops! But remember, every master was once a disaster!"
        emoji = "🔥"
    
    return f"{emoji} Grade: {grade} - {message}"

# Test it out!
print(get_grade_with_style(95))  # A grade
print(get_grade_with_style(75))  # C grade
print(get_grade_with_style(45))  # F grade
```

### 🤖 Smart Traffic Light System

```python
def traffic_light_ai(light_color, pedestrian_waiting=False):
    """
    An intelligent traffic light system with pedestrian detection!
    """
    if light_color == "red":
        if pedestrian_waiting:
            action = "🚶‍♀️ WALK signal activated! Safe crossing ahead!"
        else:
            action = "🛑 STOP! Take a breather, check your phone, maybe tweet something witty."
    elif light_color == "yellow":
        action = "⚠️  CAUTION! Prepare to stop (unless you're already in the intersection)."
    elif light_color == "green":
        action = "✅ GO! Drive safely and remember - speed limits are suggestions... just kidding, follow them!"
    else:
        action = "🚨 MALFUNCTION! When in doubt, treat as a 4-way stop and pray!"
    
    return action

# Test the system
print(traffic_light_ai("red", True))
print(traffic_light_ai("green"))
print(traffic_light_ai("purple"))  # Edge case!
```

### 🎯 Short-Circuit Evaluation Magic

Python is smart and uses **short-circuit evaluation** - it stops checking conditions once it finds a match!

```python
# This is EFFICIENT! 
def check_user_access(user):
    if user.is_admin:
        return "🔑 Admin access granted! You have the keys to the kingdom!"
    elif user.is_premium and user.subscription_active:
        return "⭐ Premium access granted! Enjoy the VIP treatment!"
    elif user.is_registered:
        return "👋 Welcome back! Standard access granted."
    else:
        return "🚪 Please register or log in to continue your journey!"

# Python stops at the first True condition - super efficient!
```

---

## 🎨 One-Line Conditionals (Ternary Operators)

### When You Want to Be Concise and Cool 😎

The ternary operator is like the sports car of conditionals - compact, fast, and stylish!

```python
# Syntax: value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
result = "YES" if condition else "NO"
```

### 🎪 Fun Examples

```python
# Example 1: Age-based greeting
age = 25
greeting = "🍺 Want a beer?" if age >= 21 else "🥤 How about some juice?"
print(greeting)

# Example 2: Weather-based outfit recommendation
weather = "rainy"
outfit = "🌂 Don't forget your umbrella!" if weather == "rainy" else "😎 You're good to go!"
print(outfit)

# Example 3: Dynamic file naming
filename = "data.csv"
is_backup = True
final_name = f"backup_{filename}" if is_backup else filename
print(f"Saving as: {final_name}")

# Example 4: Smart error messaging
error_count = 3
status = "😱 Houston, we have problems!" if error_count > 0 else "🎉 All systems operational!"
print(status)

# Example 5: Chained ternary (use sparingly!)
score = 85
grade = ("A" if score >= 90 else 
         "B" if score >= 80 else 
         "C" if score >= 70 else 
         "F")
print(f"Your grade: {grade}")
```

### 🚀 Real-World Ternary Applications

```python
# API Response Handler
def format_api_response(data):
    return {
        'status': 'success' if data else 'error',
        'message': 'Data retrieved successfully!' if data else 'No data found.',
        'count': len(data) if data else 0,
        'has_data': True if data else False
    }

# Smart Default Values
def create_user_profile(name, age=None):
    profile = {
        'name': name,
        'age_display': f"{age} years old" if age else "Age not specified",
        'is_adult': age >= 18 if age else "Unknown",
        'category': "adult" if (age and age >= 18) else "minor" if age else "unknown"
    }
    return profile
```

## 🏢 Indentation: Python's Secret Sauce

### Why Indentation is Actually Awesome! 🎯

Unlike other languages that use curly braces `{}`, Python uses **indentation** to define code blocks. This makes code incredibly readable!

```python
# Python way (Beautiful and clean!)
if user.is_authenticated:
    if user.has_permission("read"):
        if data_exists:
            return render_data()
        else:
            return "No data available"
    else:
        return "Permission denied"
else:
    return "Please log in"

# Compare to other languages (Curly brace nightmare!)
# if (user.isAuthenticated()) {
#     if (user.hasPermission("read")) {
#         if (dataExists()) {
#             return renderData();
#         } else {
#             return "No data available";
#         }
#     } else {
#         return "Permission denied";
#     }
# } else {
#     return "Please log in";
# }
```

### 📏 Indentation Rules & Best Practices

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Consistent 4-space indentation
def good_example():
    if True:
        print("Level 1")
        if True:
            print("Level 2")
            if True:
                print("Level 3")

# ❌ BAD: Mixed indentation (will cause IndentationError!)
def bad_example():
    if True:
      print("2 spaces")
        print("4 spaces")  # This will break!
```

### 🔧 Pro Indentation Tips

```python
# Tip 1: Use consistent indentation (PEP 8 recommends 4 spaces)
# Tip 2: Avoid mixing tabs and spaces
# Tip 3: Most editors can show invisible characters

# Beautiful nested conditionals with proper indentation
def process_user_request(user, action, resource):
    """A well-indented function that handles complex logic"""
    if user.is_authenticated:
        print("🔐 User authenticated")
        
        if user.has_permission(action, resource):
            print("✅ Permission granted")
            
            if resource.is_available():
                print("📦 Resource available")
                return execute_action(action, resource)
            else:
                print("❌ Resource unavailable")
                return "Resource is currently unavailable"
        else:
            print("🚫 Permission denied")
            return "You don't have permission for this action"
    else:
        print("🔒 Authentication required")
        return "Please log in to continue"
```

## 🔥 Advanced Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+)

### Meet the Game Changer: match-case Statements! 🎯

Python 3.10 introduced **structural pattern matching** - it's like `if-elif-else` on steroids! 💪

```python
# Basic match-case syntax
match variable:
    case pattern1:
        # Do something
    case pattern2:
        # Do something else
    case _:  # Wildcard (default case)
        # Default action
```

### 🎮 Epic Pattern Matching Examples

#### 1. HTTP Status Code Handler

```python
def handle_http_status(status_code):
    """
    A superhero HTTP status handler using match-case!
    """
    match status_code:
        case 200:
            return "🎉 SUCCESS! Everything is awesome!"
        case 201:
            return "✨ CREATED! Something new has been born!"
        case 400:
            return "😅 BAD REQUEST! Check your syntax, buddy!"
        case 401:
            return "🔐 UNAUTHORIZED! Who goes there?"
        case 403:
            return "🚫 FORBIDDEN! This area is off-limits!"
        case 404:
            return "🕵️ NOT FOUND! The digital equivalent of Bigfoot!"
        case 500:
            return "💥 SERVER ERROR! The server had a little oopsie!"
        case _:
            return f"🤷 UNKNOWN STATUS ({status_code})! This is uncharted territory!"

# Test it out!
print(handle_http_status(200))
print(handle_http_status(404))
print(handle_http_status(999))
```

#### 2. OR Patterns with the Pipe Operator

```python
def categorize_day(day):
    """
    Categorize days using the awesome OR operator (|)
    """
    match day.lower():
        case "saturday" | "sunday":
            return "🎉 WEEKEND! Time to party (or sleep in)!"
        case "monday":
            return "😱 MONDAY! The struggle is real!"
        case "tuesday" | "wednesday" | "thursday":
            return "💪 MIDWEEK! You're in the thick of it!"
        case "friday":
            return "🎊 FRIDAY! Almost there, warrior!"
        case _:
            return "🤔 Is that even a day? Check your calendar!"

# Weekend vibes
print(categorize_day("Saturday"))  # 🎉 WEEKEND!
print(categorize_day("Monday"))    # 😱 MONDAY!
```

#### 3. Advanced Pattern Matching with Sequences

```python
def analyze_coordinates(point):
    """
    Analyze coordinate points like a mathematical wizard! 🧙‍♂️
    """
    match point:
        case [0, 0]:
            return "📍 ORIGIN! You're at the center of the universe!"
        case [0, y]:
            return f"📏 Y-AXIS! Vertical line at y={y}"
        case [x, 0]:
            return f"📐 X-AXIS! Horizontal line at x={x}"
        case [x, y] if x == y:
            return f"🔄 DIAGONAL! Perfect 45° line at ({x}, {y})"
        case [x, y] if x > 0 and y > 0:
            return f"🌟 QUADRANT I! Positive vibes at ({x}, {y})"
        case [x, y] if x < 0 and y > 0:
            return f"🌙 QUADRANT II! Mixed feelings at ({x}, {y})"
        case [x, y] if x < 0 and y < 0:
            return f"🌑 QUADRANT III! Negative space at ({x}, {y})"
        case [x, y] if x > 0 and y < 0:
            return f"⭐ QUADRANT IV! Almost there at ({x}, {y})"
        case [x, y, z]:
            return f"🚀 3D SPACE! Flying high at ({x}, {y}, {z})"
        case _:
            return "🌀 UNKNOWN DIMENSION! This point defies physics!"

# Test the coordinate analyzer
print(analyze_coordinates([0, 0]))      # Origin
print(analyze_coordinates([3, 3]))      # Diagonal
print(analyze_coordinates([1, 2, 3]))   # 3D point
```

#### 4. Dictionary Pattern Matching

```python
def process_api_response(response):
    """
    Smart API response processor using dictionary patterns!
    """
    match response:
        case {"status": "success", "data": data, "count": count}:
            return f"🎯 SUCCESS! Got {count} items: {data[:50]}..."
        case {"status": "error", "message": msg, "code": code}:
            return f"💥 ERROR {code}: {msg}"
        case {"status": "loading"}:
            return "⏳ LOADING! Please wait while we work our magic..."
        case {"status": "empty"}:
            return "📭 EMPTY! No data found, but that's okay!"
        case {"user": {"name": name, "role": "admin"}}:
            return f"👑 ADMIN ACCESS! Welcome back, {name}!"
        case _:
            return "🤷 UNKNOWN RESPONSE! This is new territory!"

# Test API responses
success_response = {"status": "success", "data": ["item1", "item2"], "count": 2}
error_response = {"status": "error", "message": "Database timeout", "code": 500}

print(process_api_response(success_response))
print(process_api_response(error_response))
```

#### 5. Class Pattern Matching

```python
# Define some classes for pattern matching
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, level, health):
        self.name = name
        self.level = level
        self.health = health

class Monster:
    def __init__(self, species, power):
        self.species = species
        self.power = power

class Item:
    def __init__(self, name, rarity):
        self.name = name
        self.rarity = rarity

def handle_game_entity(entity):
    """
    Handle different game entities like a pro game developer! 🎮
    """
    match entity:
        case Player(name=name, level=level) if level >= 50:
            return f"🏆 LEGEND {name}! Level {level} master detected!"
        case Player(name=name, health=health) if health <= 10:
            return f"💔 {name} needs healing! Only {health} HP left!"
        case Player(name=name, level=level):
            return f"⚔️ Warrior {name} (Level {level}) ready for battle!"
        case Monster(species="dragon", power=power) if power > 1000:
            return f"🐉 ANCIENT DRAGON! Power level: {power} - RUN!"
        case Monster(species=species, power=power):
            return f"👹 {species.title()} spotted! Power: {power}"
        case Item(name=name, rarity="legendary"):
            return f"✨ LEGENDARY ITEM: {name}! Your luck is incredible!"
        case Item(name=name, rarity=rarity):
            return f"📦 {rarity.title()} item: {name}"
        case _:
            return "❓ Unknown entity! Prepare for the unexpected!"

# Test game entities
hero = Player("CodeWarrior", 75, 100)
dragon = Monster("dragon", 1500)
sword = Item("Excalibur", "legendary")

print(handle_game_entity(hero))
print(handle_game_entity(dragon))
print(handle_game_entity(sword))
```

## 🚀 Best Practices & Pro Tips

### 🎯 Writing Pythonic Conditionals

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Use truthiness naturally
if items:  # Better than if len(items) > 0
    process_items(items)

# ✅ GOOD: Use 'not' for readability
if not user.is_authenticated:  # Better than if user.is_authenticated == False
    redirect_to_login()

# ✅ GOOD: Use 'in' for membership testing
if status in ['success', 'completed', 'finished']:  # Better than multiple ORs
    celebrate()

# ✅ GOOD: Use guard clauses to reduce nesting
def process_user(user):
    if not user:
        return "No user provided"
    
    if not user.is_active:
        return "User inactive"
    
    # Main logic here with less indentation
    return perform_user_action(user)
```

### 🧠 Performance Tips

```python
# ✅ EFFICIENT: Short-circuit evaluation
def expensive_check():
    print("This is expensive!")
    return True

def quick_check():
    print("This is quick!")
    return False

# Only quick_check() runs because of short-circuit evaluation
if quick_check() and expensive_check():
    print("Both conditions met")

# ✅ EFFICIENT: Use elif instead of multiple ifs when mutually exclusive
grade = 85
# GOOD: Only one condition is evaluated
if grade >= 90:
    result = "A"
elif grade >= 80:  # This won't run if grade >= 90
    result = "B"
elif grade >= 70:
    result = "C"

# ❌ INEFFICIENT: All conditions are evaluated
if grade >= 90:
    result = "A"
if grade >= 80 and grade < 90:  # Always evaluated
    result = "B"
if grade >= 70 and grade < 80:  # Always evaluated
    result = "C"
```

### 🎨 Code Organization Tips

```python
# ✅ EXCELLENT: Extract complex conditions into functions
def is_business_hours():
    current_hour = datetime.now().hour
    return 9 <= current_hour <= 17

def is_weekday():
    return datetime.now().weekday() < 5

def should_send_notification():
    return is_business_hours() and is_weekday()

# Clean and readable
if should_send_notification():
    send_notification()

# ✅ EXCELLENT: Use constants for magic numbers
ADULT_AGE = 18
SENIOR_AGE = 65
RETIREMENT_AGE = 67

def categorize_person(age):
    if age < ADULT_AGE:
        return "Minor"
    elif age < SENIOR_AGE:
        return "Adult"
    elif age < RETIREMENT_AGE:
        return "Senior"
    else:
        return "Retired"
```

## 🐛 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ⚠️ The Dangerous Traps!

```python
# ❌ TRAP 1: Assignment vs Comparison
user_age = 25

# Wrong - This assigns 18 to user_age!
if user_age = 18:  # SyntaxError in Python (good!)
    print("Teenager")

# Correct
if user_age == 18:
    print("Teenager")

# ❌ TRAP 2: Floating Point Comparisons
# Don't do this with floats!
if 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3:  # This is False due to floating point precision!
    print("Math works!")

# Do this instead
import math
if math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3):
    print("Math works!")

# ❌ TRAP 3: Mutable Default Arguments
def add_item(item, items=[]):  # DANGEROUS!
    items.append(item)
    return items

# This will cause problems!
list1 = add_item("apple")
list2 = add_item("banana")
print(list2)  # ['apple', 'banana'] - Oops!

# Correct way
def add_item(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items

# ❌ TRAP 4: Chained Comparisons Confusion
age = 25

# This might not do what you think!
if 18 < age < 65 and age < 30:  # Redundant condition
    print("Young adult")

# Be explicit and clear
if 18 < age < 30:
    print("Young adult")

# ❌ TRAP 5: Using 'is' for Value Comparison
# Wrong - 'is' checks identity, not equality
name = "John"
if name is "John":  # Don't do this!
    print("Hello John")

# Correct - Use == for value comparison
if name == "John":
    print("Hello John")

# 'is' is for identity (same object in memory)
if name is None:  # This is correct - None is a singleton
    print("No name provided")
```

    """
    Tips for debugging complex conditionals

    # Tip 1: Use print statements strategically
    user_score = 75

        grade = "C or lower"
    
    print(f"Debug: Final grade = {grade}")
    
    # Tip 2: Break complex conditions into variables
    is_weekend = True
    is_holiday = False
    has_urgent_work = True
    
    # Instead of:
    # if (is_weekend or is_holiday) and not has_urgent_work:
    
    # Do this for better debugging:
    is_free_day = is_weekend or is_holiday
    can_relax = is_free_day and not has_urgent_work

    - Factor in attendance (below 80% = penalty)
    - Apply late penalties
    - Use letter grades with +/- modifiers
    - Handle edge cases (empty scores, invalid data)
    - Return detailed breakdown
    
    Use all conditional patterns we learned!

    def optimize_usage(self):
        # Your code here - suggest better usage patterns!
        pass

# Test your energy manager
manager = EnergyManager("time_of_use")
manager.add_device("AC", 3000, 8)
manager.add_device("TV", 150, 6)
manager.add_device("Lights", 500, 12)

print(manager.calculate_daily_cost())
print(manager.emergency_power_mode(30))  # Only 30% power available
print(manager.optimize_usage())
